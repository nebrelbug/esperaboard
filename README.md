A Chrome Extension that converts Esperanto x-system into accented letters as you type! I based this off of jcreedcmu's amazing [Anstatauxi](https://github.com/jcreedcmu/anstatauxi) extension, but fixed a couple of bugs and rewrote it so that it should work with most modern text editors that use div's instead of inputs.

Click on the extension to toggle (enable or disable) it, and right-click to choose whether to convert 'ux' or 'vx' to 'Å­'.

Hope you enjoy this!
